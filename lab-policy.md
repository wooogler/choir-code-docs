# Lab Policies

## Conference Travel

After returning from the conference, you will receive another form from Teresa to complete the reimbursement.

  * [CS Grad Council](https://csgrad.cs.vt.edu/travel_funding/)
  * [GPSS](https://gpss.vt.edu/programs/tfp.html)
  * [GRDP](https://gpss.vt.edu/programs/grdp.html)

  * Conference-specific travel support, if available.


## Time Off
