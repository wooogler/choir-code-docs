# Exam Scheduling (Prelim & Final)

## Step One: Student Initiates Exam Request

- Student submits exam request **at least two weeks** before intended exam date. Must have approved **Plan of Study (POS)**.
- Exam request system populates **committee members** from POS.
- When seeking an external committee member for a Ph.D. or M.S. advisory committee, it is typical for an advisor to suggest a few names of individuals who have expertise in the dissertation topic. The student is more than welcome to suggest names too.
- Automated email notice is sent to chair and committee members requesting approval. No action notice sent to GPD and GC.
- All committee members **approve** exam request.

## Step Two: Graduate School Review

- Request is reviewed by **assigned admission & academic progress advisor** in the Graduate School.

## Step Three: Exam

- Exam is held on scheduled date.
- **Chair enters exam results** within two business days. Automated email notice is sent to committee members.
- Committee members verify their **vote of approval/disapproval** in the exam request system.
- Graduate School **finalizes results** as “Completed” in the approval system.
